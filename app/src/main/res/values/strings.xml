    <string name="bio">I am a highly motivated software developer with two years of experience in the field. \n\nMy project portfolio
includes work in C# and Java, and I have a fundamental understanding of machine learning. \n\nSeeking new
challenges, I embarked on the NUS-ISS GDipSA program, where I adeptly mastered Agile Methodology
and SDLC for application design.
\n\nDuring my internship at NUS-DCEE as part of the GDipSA program, I functioned as a full-stack developer.
I utilized Next.js for the frontend, NodeJS for the backend, and AWS for cloud services. \n\nAdditionally, I was
involved in creating 3D structural designs for buildings. \n\nAs an enthusiastic and proactive learner with a
genuine passion for coding and problem-solving, I am now actively seeking opportunities to apply my
skills, enthusiasm, and strong work ethic in a software development role. \n\n I had done a lot of projects
        implemented with Java, C#, Android, Ruby-On-Rails, ReactJs, NextJs, NodeJs, AWS, MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL.</string>
