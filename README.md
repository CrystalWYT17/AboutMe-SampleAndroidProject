**Sample Kotlin Project**

This project is from [Udacity Kotlin Course](https://www.udacity.com/enrollment/ud9012).

This app includes:
- show user name after user gave input
- show description with scrollable view
- disappear button and input box after user click done

 **I give credits to this course and instructors.**
